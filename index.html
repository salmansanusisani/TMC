        <h2 id="chapterUn">Chapter 1: Cringe Meeting</h2>
        <p>
          <b>I</b>t was a day in school. All senior secondary students were writing their final year
          examinations called WAEC/NECO ‚Äî the West African Examinations Council exam carried 
          out in several African countries every year. Among those millions of students was a 17-year-old 
          student named Salman.<br><br>

          As Salman and his classmates were writing WAEC, new students joined them. 
          They weren‚Äôt from the school ‚Äî just external candidates. Among them was a male candidate and a 
          female candidate. From the moment the female student arrived, Salman noticed her immediately. 
          It‚Äôs natural to notice someone new in your surroundings. At first, it was just curiosity.<br><br>

          If you were to ask Salman to describe her, he would say she was a young, very neat lady around 18 or 19 years old. She appeared to be a black beauty, slightly chubby, 
          always neat and flashy. Without a doubt, he knew she was a 10/10. But she wasn‚Äôt his type. 
          He acknowledged her beauty,  but he didn‚Äôt view her as someone he could ever fall for. According to him, 
          her class was far above his ‚Äî but he didn‚Äôt care much. Still, something in him wanted to be 
          friends with her. She looked intimidating, but he wasn‚Äôt really intimidated.<br><br>

          One day in the exam hall, before the exam began, Salman and his friend Musa were passing 
          time by quizzing each other on the 2011 anime <i>Hunter x Hunter</i>. Whoever answered first 
          got a point, and the first to reach 10 points won. The loser had to buy the winner a drink. 
          After a heated round, Salman turned out victorious, so Musa owed him a drink after the exam.<br><br>

          Feeling playful, Salman dared Musa to talk to the newcomer. Musa refused, even when offered 
          5k. Instead, Musa flipped the dare back on Salman. Salman paused ‚Äî ‚ÄúIs today my lucky day? 
          Free 5k plus a free drink, and I already wanted to talk to her.‚Äù So he agreed.<br><br>

          But Musa added a condition: Salman had to approach her with a cringe pickup line ‚Äî smooth only if executed correctly. He even showed Salman the pickup line video on his phone. 
          Risking his reputation for 5k, Salman went straight to where she was sitting, reading a book, appeared right in front of her, and said, "Where did you get that?" She looked at Salman very
          confused and was like, "Huh??" Salman was supposed to finish the pickup line by saying, "Where did you get that beauty?" so she would smile and everything would go as he imagined. But suddenly, a lot of thoughts started flooding his mind: <i>What if it looks weird when I say it? What if she laughs at me?</i> This froze his brain for seconds, making him look like a statue, and she also looked at him like, "What? I'm listening." He couldn't stand the pressure and searched for a smooth way to get out of this trap, but after his mini calculations, he realized there was no way out. He just had to say it. So he finished the pickup line, saying, "Where did you get that beauty?" She looked at him in a weird way, thinking, "What kind of cringe guy is this?" Salman knew at that moment he had just messed up and lost aura in front of this new girl. He tried to act a little cool by asking her name. He said, "What's your name?" She replied, "Khadija." He said, "Okay, nice to meet you," and left with a fake smile on his face, trying to convince himself: "This is just a newcomer who came to write exams with us. When we're done, I'm never going to see her again, so just forget this ever happened." With that, he was able to convince himself and move on.<br><br>

          After the cringe incident, he went back to his friend Musa, who was shocked to see that Salman completed the challenge. After the exams, Salman and Musa went to a nearby mini-mart in the school, where Musa bought him the drink as promised and transferred the 5k to his account without any argument, knowing how rough it went. At last, Salman felt some relief, but that memory still lowkey haunted him. He thought, "So there is a girl who‚Äôs going to see me as a cringy person now." He knew the experience was not the best, and worst of all, what if she told other girls? Salman was going to lose more aura. He lowkey accepted his destiny and moved on. So every time he saw her, he would just say hi like they had met before and chat, so they were no longer strangers. She always replied with a smile, like a normal person would, as if nothing had ever happened.<br><br>

          Under normal circumstances, Salman would never do that, but he was kind of a risk-taker, so he somehow learned a new lesson. The only thing that made the first meeting cringe was that Salman went in with full confidence, overthought it, and lost that confidence, resulting in the awkward moment he had with her. This is a moment that can never be forgotten, so he named the incident "THE AURA GAMBIT." He calls it <i>the aura gambit</i> because he sacrificed all the risk to either lose aura on the pickup line or gain aura, which turned out negative. In the game of chess, players sacrifice a valuable piece in order to gain something big later on, which is known as a <i>gambit.</i>

            <!-- Chapter 2 -->
      <section class="chapter">
        <h2 id="chapterDeux">Chapter 2: Unexpected Bond</h2>
        <p>
          After the <i>Aura Gambit</i> incident, the exam period was nearing its end, with only two papers remaining. Salman was a talented artist who loved drawing. Whenever he finished an exam early, instead of sitting and waiting for time to pass, he sketched on his question paper to keep busy.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day in the exam hall, he was drawing <b>Ryomen Sukuna</b> from <i>Jujutsu Kaisen</i> when a female classmate picked up another student‚Äôs question paper and showed it to him. On it was a drawing of a beautiful dress. The moment Salman saw it, his excitement spiked. <i>Who is this good? I need to know. I want to challenge whoever drew this.</i> Without wasting time, he asked whose drawing it was. She pointed to the newcomer, Khadija.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying to play it cool, Salman said, ‚ÄúI like your drawing.‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù He followed up with, ‚ÄúSince we‚Äôre both done with our exams, let‚Äôs have a drawing contest to see who‚Äôs the best.‚Äù Khadija accepted immediately, as if the awkward first encounter had never happened. They both got to work, turning their question papers into mini‚Äìmasterpieces. Salman felt relieved; her willingness to accept the challenge meant she either didn‚Äôt see the earlier incident as a big deal or didn‚Äôt even recognize him as the same guy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When time was up and students began to leave, Salman went over to Khadija. She was adding final touches, then smiled and said, ‚ÄúLet me see yours.‚Äù He showed her his Sukuna drawing. There was one complication ‚Äî their styles were completely different. Salman‚Äôs art was anime-style, while Khadija‚Äôs leaned into fashion design, which made judging fairly a challenge. One of Khadija‚Äôs friends offered to judge. Unsurprisingly, the girls preferred the fashion illustration and picked Khadija as the winner. Deep down, Salman still believed his piece was stronger, but he also knew they might not fully appreciate his style. Khadija then brought out her phone and took pictures of both drawings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, both Salman and Khadija walked away feeling like winners. That moment marked the start of their unexpected bond‚Äîart was the bridge that connected them. The next day was the last day of their exams, so they prepared for their final drawing challenge. As soon as they finished their papers, both got to work. Salman knew she didn‚Äôt stand a chance against him, but he still played along. That day Salman was drawing one of his favorite anime characters, <i>Roronoa Zoro</i> from the famous anime series <i>One Piece</i>, while Khadija was drawing another dress, meticulously shading and adding all the details it needed to stand out.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the exam ended and everyone submitted their booklets, Salman went to Khadija and said, ‚ÄúLet me see yours.‚Äù Khadija playfully turned her question paper upside down and said, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not done. Let me see yours first.‚Äù Salman placed his paper on her desk, and she smiled before finally turning hers over to show him. The same problem occurred ‚Äî their drawing styles were different, making it hard to judge. Once again, the girls picked Khadija‚Äôs as the better one, but they all agreed Salman‚Äôs drawing had crazy details. Salman wasn‚Äôt satisfied, so he called his friend Musa, who without hesitation said Salman‚Äôs was better. Still, that didn‚Äôt convince the others, so Salman just played along. Deep down, he knew he was the real winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          After their last meeting, Salman and Khadija left the school as art-challenge friends. Salman didn‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôd meet again, so he forgot about her. But fate had other plans. While scrolling on Instagram, Salman saw a familiar face in his account suggestions ‚Äî it was Khadija. Excited, he clicked on the account, confirmed it was her, and followed her, hoping she‚Äôd follow back. He even sent her a reel about artists to get her attention, but days passed and she didn‚Äôt notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, the school later called all the exam candidates for a meeting. Only a few students showed up, including Salman and Khadija. After the meeting, as everyone gathered outside, Khadija stood by herself using her phone. Salman, who was nearby with friends, noticed her and felt something telling him to go talk to her. He walked up and greeted her. She smiled and said, ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù Salman asked, ‚ÄúDid you see my Instagram account? I followed you.‚Äù She checked and realized she hadn‚Äôt noticed because she had multiple accounts. She followed him back and explained that the account he found wasn‚Äôt her main one. Salman asked why she had so many accounts, and she just smiled and said, ‚ÄúI just like it that way.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          They didn‚Äôt talk much at the time, but at least she had followed him back and replied to his message. That meant they had a chance to keep communicating even after school. Later that day, after going to the mini-mart with friends, Salman returned and found most students had gone home. Only a few remained, including Khadija. This time, Salman and Khadija started having a deeper conversation without even realizing it. They introduced themselves properly and talked a lot. That day, they truly understood each other better. If not for that moment, they wouldn‚Äôt have connected the way they did.
          And that was an unexpected bound.
        </p>
      </section>
<section class="chapter">
  <h2 id="chapterTrois">Chapter 3: Deeper Bond</h2>
  <p>
    That evening, after returning home, Salman found himself once again drawn into a long conversation with Khadija. At first, it was casual‚Äîlittle fragments of laughter, stories about the day‚Äîbut the chat stretched on longer than either of them had expected. The more they typed, the more they discovered pieces of themselves hidden in the other. <br><br>

    Khadija spoke with a quiet passion about her love for books, how they offered her entire worlds to escape into. Salman, in turn, shared his interests: documentaries, history, the kinds of things that most people around him would brush aside as boring. But he quickly noticed she wasn‚Äôt the kind of person who would thrive in long, technical discussions about computers and codes‚Äîthe world he usually lived in. So, instead of burying her under the weight of his obsessions, he let those stay in the background. What mattered was finding the bridge between them, and as if by chance, they both landed on one thing they shared: art. <br><br>

    The discovery of that common ground lit something in Salman. That night they spoke endlessly about history, documentaries ,art and alot of other things. And in that moment, Salman felt something unusual‚Äîa sense of connection, fragile but real, a warmth he hadn‚Äôt felt in years. <br><br>

    Their chats became a rhythm of life. Day after day, night after night, they shared stories, jokes, interests and thoughts. Khadija had an energy about her‚Äîa willingness to give her time and attention in a way that startled Salman. He thought back to the <i>Aura Gambit incident</i>, the awkwardness that could have broken any fragile friendship before it began. Yet here she was, speaking to him like none of it mattered. He never asked her why. He didn‚Äôt need to. The way she stayed was answer enough. <br><br>

    Weeks slipped by, and graduation loomed closer. Salman knew, in the back of his mind, that it would be the last time they would meet in person. Life would scatter everyone in different directions, as it always did. But instead of clinging to dread, he kept things normal, burying the thought with every conversation. <br><br>

    Khadija, with her entrepreneurial mindset sells shawarma, since shawarma happened to be one of his favorite meals. When he ordered one, she promised to bring it for him on graduation day. The thought lingered with him, becoming part of the quiet anticipation of the event. <br><br>

    Not long before the big day, Salman asked Khadija for a picture of herself so he could draw her. She agreed. That night, while the house was silent and the rest of the world slept, he sat hunched over his desk with paper and pencil in hand. He drew her with meticulous care, pausing often, erasing, redrawing, making sure every detail resembled her. It wasn‚Äôt just a sketch. To him, it was a gift, a memory frozen in lines and shadows. He imagined her reaction when he handed it over. For Salman, drawing had always been personal. He never drew men. It was only women he found beautiful, To draw a girl meant her beauty was acknoledged by him. <br><br>

    The graduation day finally arrived. The air was alive with excitement, Everyone‚Äôs faces glowed with relief and joy‚Äîyears of effort had finally come to an end. Salman walked into the hall, His eyes searched restlessly, looking for only one person: Khadija. <br><br>

    She had told him she would be late; her makeup took nearly an hour. It made Salman laugh when she said it, but in that moment, waiting for her, the minutes stretched endlessly. The ceremony came and went, speeches echoing, applause rising, the collective joy of a class reaching its final moment together. And then, outside the hall, amidst the sea of gowns and laughter, Salman finally saw her. <br><br>

    His excitement bubbled to the surface as he approached her. ‚ÄúI have a surprise for you,‚Äù he said, unable to keep the grin off his face. She tilted her head playfully, eyes bright. ‚ÄúOh, let me see!‚Äù she replied. Salman pulled out the folded paper and placed it in her hands. But instead of opening it, she simply smiled and tucked it away. He didn‚Äôt understand why, but oddly, he liked it. It felt as though she was saving the moment, holding it close, making it hers in silence. <br><br>

    Then she handed him his shawarma, neatly wrapped. Salman laughed quietly to himself, slipping it into his pocket like a prized treasure before going off to greet parents, classmates, and old friends. Later, he called one of his homie musa aside, unwrapped the shawarma, and devoured it, every bite tasting better than the last, because of who it came from. <br><br>

    The day rolled into celebration. The graduating class made their way to a restaurant a few miles away. The atmosphere was alive with light and sound‚ÄîRGB colors danced across the walls, music pounded through the speakers, and laughter echoed in every corner. Plates of food filled the tables, people played games, danced wildly, and captured every moment in photos. Salman wanted to speak more with Khadija, but she was often with one of her sisters. The timing wasn‚Äôt right, and the setting was too loud. Still, just being in the same room, watching her from afar, felt enough. <br><br>

    That night ended with joy, and as everyone returned home, Salman carried with him something deeper than simple happiness‚Äîhe carried contentment. <br><br>

    From that day on, their friendship only grew stronger. They spoke every day, about everything and nothing. Sometimes they challenged each other with drawing competitions, sometimes they discuss about anime, and sometimes they just sent each other reels that somehow made sense only between them. Their bond deepened like roots intertwining beneath the surface, invisible but unbreakable. <br><br>

    They even turned their bond into a kind of game‚Äîa ‚Äúside quest,‚Äù as they called it. Khadija would recommend a book for Salman to read in a week, while he would recommend an anime for her to watch. At the end of the week,so that they‚Äôd  share their thoughts later on.<br><br>

    For Khadija, the anime was an easy task‚Äîshe had always been a fan. But for Salman, the book was torture. He hated reading. The endless pages, the tiny text, the heavy words that seemed to mock him‚Äîit was everything he had always avoided. Yet when Khadija recommended <i>The Poppy War</i>, he didn‚Äôt refuse. He forced himself through page after page, eyes watering from the strain of reading on a screen, constantly pausing to search up difficult words. But he never quit. He had made her a promise, and more than that, he wanted to honor their bond. <br><br>

    Slowly, the story began to take hold of him. What started as a chore became something else. Each night, before sleep, he reads it, reading until exhaustion made his eyelids heavy. To his surprise, he began to enjoy it. The fatigue even lulled him into deeper sleep. <br><br>

    Meanwhile, Khadija had taken his recommendation seriously and was watching <i>Vinland Saga</i>, an anime Salman considered one of the best he had ever seen that year. <br><br>

    And in the midst of all this‚Äîbetween the reels, the drawings, the side quests,Salman realized something. Khadija was the first female friend he had ever acknowledged as a true friend. For the first time in his life.

<section class="chapter">
  <h2 id="chapterQuatre">Chapter 4: The Chess Date</h2>
  <p>
    The news came without warning. <br>
    <i>‚ÄúSalman, you‚Äôre leaving Abuja.‚Äù</i><br><br>

    His sister‚Äôs words echoed in his head, and for a moment, it felt like the world had tilted. He wasn‚Äôt ready. He wasn‚Äôt prepared. The ground beneath his life shifted too suddenly, leaving him dizzy with a mixture of disbelief and sorrow. He had been in Abuja, finishing his exams while the rest of his family had already moved back to Kano. Now the time had come to join them, and though he knew it was inevitable, he hadn‚Äôt expected it to be this soon. The realization struck him with one painful truth: he would never see Khadija again.<br><br>

    That night, while the city outside his window hummed faintly, he sat with his phone in his hand, heart restless. He was supposed to go swimming with Musa the next day for one last memory with his closest friend. But another longing weighed heavier, something he could not ignore. If he was truly leaving, he needed to see Khadija one more time. Not just in passing. Not casually. He needed a moment with her alone, something real, something lasting.<br><br>

    His fingers trembled slightly as he typed the message:<br>
    <i>‚ÄúWould you like to meet me tomorrow for a chess date? Just you and me‚Ä¶ before I leave.‚Äù</i><br><br>

    Then came the silence. Minutes stretched endlessly. He checked his phone over and over, the anxiety knotting tighter in his chest with every passing second. The weight of no reply crushed him until exhaustion dragged his worried heart into sleep.<br><br>

    The next morning, light filtered through his window, and the very first thing he did was check his phone. His heart skipped‚Äîshe had replied. <b>She said yes.</b><br><br>

    Relief washed over him, but it wasn‚Äôt just relief‚Äîit was joy, sharp and overwhelming. For her, perhaps, it was just kindness, friendship, a simple gesture. But for him, it was everything. That she would choose to spend part of his last day with him‚Ä¶ it made him feel honored, valued, seen.<br><br>

    He set the venue: <b>Jabi Lake Mall.</b> A vast, lively place where laughter mingled with the hum of shops and the breeze off the lake carried the scent of water and sky. The time was set‚Äî1:30 p.m.<br><br>

    Salman hurried to get ready. He bathed quickly, pulled on casual clothes, but then chaos broke out‚Äîhis chessboard. His nephews had scattered the pieces, and in a frenzy he searched every corner. At last, he managed to gather almost all of them, though a few pawns were missing. Desperate but determined, he replaced them with checkers pieces, chuckling softly at the irony. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but real friendship connections rarely were.<br><br>

    He arrived at the mall half an hour early. He walked slowly along the lake‚Äôs edge, the breeze cool against his face, before choosing a quiet table outside. There, with steady hands, he set up the chessboard as though preparing not for a game, but for a memory.<br><br>

    When her message came‚Äî<i>‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way‚Äù</i>‚Äîhis pulse quickened.<br>
    Minutes later, her call lit up his screen.<br>
    <i>‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the mall now. Where are you?‚Äù</i><br><br>

    His voice carried a thrill he tried to disguise. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm outside, by the lake. Keep walking‚ÄîI‚Äôll find you.‚Äù<br><br>

    He rose and began moving through the crowd, eyes darting like a pirate searching for treasure. Then‚Äîhe saw her. Her walk was familiar, yet everything about that moment made it new. His breath caught as his gaze lifted to her face. There she was‚ÄîKhadija‚Äîher smile glowing bright. For a heartbeat, the world around him dimmed.<br><br>

    He raised his hand instinctively, smiling with a joy he could no longer contain. She smiled back, that radiant warmth that seemed to say <i>I see you too.</i><br><br>

    At their table, he taught her chess. She listened attentively, surprising him with how quickly she learned. Her eyes sparkled when she grasped each rule, each move, each small strategy. In no time, they were playing a real game. Yet even as the pieces clicked against the board, Salman was more focused on the way she leaned forward in concentration, the way her smile broke through when she understood something new.<br><br>

    After a while Salman asked if she wanted to rematch or have some fun. She replied, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have some fun.‚Äù<br><br>

    They wandered into an ice cream shop. Salman ordered shawarma and ice cream, Khadija only ice cream. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay you back,‚Äù she offered softly. He shook his head, smiling faintly, knowing he wouldn‚Äôt accept even if she tried. After all, he had invited her.<br><br>

    Their conversation flowed like a river‚Äîeffortless, bright. They spoke of their ‚Äúside quest,‚Äù of <i>Vinland Saga</i>, the anime he had recommended, and <i>The Poppy War</i>, the book she had urged him to read. But beneath the laughter, Salman felt the quiet ache of time slipping away. Every glance, every laugh‚Äîhe held onto them as though they were already memories.<br><br>

    Later, she wanted a burger, and he walked beside her as if even that small act was sacred. They wandered through aisles, lingering over things they didn‚Äôt need, their steps slow, unhurried. For Salman, every second stretched golden, fragile, like glass he dared not break.<br><br>

    And when the day finally ended, when goodbyes hovered on their lips, Salman knew this: it wasn‚Äôt the chess, or the ice cream, or even the laughter that made it unforgettable. <b>It was her.</b> It was the way she had said yes. The way she had shown up. The way she had smiled at him.<br><br>

    As Khadija was leaving, Salman escorted her to the Uber where she left. Not long after, he also left the place‚Äîwith a heart full of joy and contentment.
