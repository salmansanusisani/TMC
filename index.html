        <p>
          <b>I</b>t was a day in school. All senior secondary students were writing their final year
          examinations called WAEC/NECO — the West African Examinations Council exam carried 
          out in several African countries every year. Among those millions of students was a 17-year-old 
          student named Salman.<br><br>

          As Salman and his classmates were writing WAEC, new students joined them. 
          They weren’t from the school — just external candidates. Among them was a male candidate and a 
          female candidate. From the moment the female student arrived, Salman noticed her immediately. 
          It’s natural to notice someone new in your surroundings. At first, it was just curiosity.<br><br>

          If you were to ask Salman to describe her, he would say she was a young, very neat lady around 18 or 19 years old. She appeared to be a black beauty, slightly chubby, 
          always neat and flashy. Without a doubt, he knew she was a 10/10. But she wasn’t his type. 
          He acknowledged her beauty,  but he didn’t view her as someone he could ever fall for. According to him, 
          her class was far above his — but he didn’t care much. Still, something in him wanted to be 
          friends with her. She looked intimidating, but he wasn’t really intimidated.<br><br>

          One day in the exam hall, before the exam began, Salman and his friend Musa were passing 
          time by quizzing each other on the 2011 anime <i>Hunter x Hunter</i>. Whoever answered first 
          got a point, and the first to reach 10 points won. The loser had to buy the winner a drink. 
          After a heated round, Salman turned out victorious, so Musa owed him a drink after the exam.<br><br>

          Feeling playful, Salman dared Musa to talk to the newcomer. Musa refused, even when offered 
          5k. Instead, Musa flipped the dare back on Salman. Salman paused — “Is today my lucky day? 
          Free 5k plus a free drink, and I already wanted to talk to her.” So he agreed.<br><br>

          But Musa added a condition: Salman had to approach her with a cringe pickup line — smooth only if executed correctly. He even showed Salman the pickup line video on his phone. 
          Risking his reputation for 5k, Salman went straight to where she was sitting, reading a book, appeared right in front of her, and said, "Where did you get that?" She looked at Salman very
          confused and was like, "Huh??" Salman was supposed to finish the pickup line by saying, "Where did you get that beauty?" so she would smile and everything would go as he imagined. But suddenly, a lot of thoughts started flooding his mind: <i>What if it looks weird when I say it? What if she laughs at me?</i> This froze his brain for seconds, making him look like a statue, and she also looked at him like, "What? I'm listening." He couldn't stand the pressure and searched for a smooth way to get out of this trap, but after his mini calculations, he realized there was no way out. He just had to say it. So he finished the pickup line, saying, "Where did you get that beauty?" She looked at him in a weird way, thinking, "What kind of cringe guy is this?" Salman knew at that moment he had just messed up and lost aura in front of this new girl. He tried to act a little cool by asking her name. He said, "What's your name?" She replied, "Khadija." He said, "Okay, nice to meet you," and left with a fake smile on his face, trying to convince himself: "This is just a newcomer who came to write exams with us. When we're done, I'm never going to see her again, so just forget this ever happened." With that, he was able to convince himself and move on.<br><br>

          After the cringe incident, he went back to his friend Musa, who was shocked to see that Salman completed the challenge. After the exams, Salman and Musa went to a nearby mini-mart in the school, where Musa bought him the drink as promised and transferred the 5k to his account without any argument, knowing how rough it went. At last, Salman felt some relief, but that memory still lowkey haunted him. He thought, "So there is a girl who’s going to see me as a cringy person now." He knew the experience was not the best, and worst of all, what if she told other girls? Salman was going to lose more aura. He lowkey accepted his destiny and moved on. So every time he saw her, he would just say hi like they had met before and chat, so they were no longer strangers. She always replied with a smile, like a normal person would, as if nothing had ever happened.<br><br>

          Under normal circumstances, Salman would never do that, but he was kind of a risk-taker, so he somehow learned a new lesson. The only thing that made the first meeting cringe was that Salman went in with full confidence, overthought it, and lost that confidence, resulting in the awkward moment he had with her. This is a moment that can never be forgotten, so he named the incident "THE AURA GAMBIT." He calls it <i>the aura gambit</i> because he sacrificed all the risk to either lose aura on the pickup line or gain aura, which turned out negative. In the game of chess, players sacrifice a valuable piece in order to gain something big later on, which is known as a <i>gambit.</i>

        <h2 id="chapterDeux">Chapter 2: Unexpected Bond</h2>
        <p>
          After the <i>Aura Gambit</i> incident, the exam period was nearing its end, with only two papers remaining. Salman was a talented artist who loved drawing. Whenever he finished an exam early, instead of sitting and waiting for time to pass, he sketched on his question paper to keep busy.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day in the exam hall, he was drawing <b>Ryomen Sukuna</b> from <i>Jujutsu Kaisen</i> when a female classmate picked up another student’s question paper and showed it to him. On it was a drawing of a beautiful dress. The moment Salman saw it, his excitement spiked. <i>Who is this good? I need to know. I want to challenge whoever drew this.</i> Without wasting time, he asked whose drawing it was. She pointed to the newcomer, Khadija.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying to play it cool, Salman said, “I like your drawing.” She replied, “Thank you.” He followed up with, “Since we’re both done with our exams, let’s have a drawing contest to see who’s the best.” Khadija accepted immediately, as if the awkward first encounter had never happened. They both got to work, turning their question papers into mini–masterpieces. Salman felt relieved; her willingness to accept the challenge meant she either didn’t see the earlier incident as a big deal or didn’t even recognize him as the same guy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When time was up and students began to leave, Salman went over to Khadija. She was adding final touches, then smiled and said, “Let me see yours.” He showed her his Sukuna drawing. There was one complication — their styles were completely different. Salman’s art was anime-style, while Khadija’s leaned into fashion design, which made judging fairly a challenge. One of Khadija’s friends offered to judge. Unsurprisingly, the girls preferred the fashion illustration and picked Khadija as the winner. Deep down, Salman still believed his piece was stronger, but he also knew they might not fully appreciate his style. Khadija then brought out her phone and took pictures of both drawings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, both Salman and Khadija walked away feeling like winners. That moment marked the start of their unexpected bond—art was the bridge that connected them. The next day was the last day of their exams, so they prepared for their final drawing challenge. As soon as they finished their papers, both got to work. Salman knew she didn’t stand a chance against him, but he still played along. That day Salman was drawing one of his favorite anime characters, <i>Roronoa Zoro</i> from the famous anime series <i>One Piece</i>, while Khadija was drawing another dress, meticulously shading and adding all the details it needed to stand out.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the exam ended and everyone submitted their booklets, Salman went to Khadija and said, “Let me see yours.” Khadija playfully turned her question paper upside down and said, “No, I’m not done. Let me see yours first.” Salman placed his paper on her desk, and she smiled before finally turning hers over to show him. The same problem occurred — their drawing styles were different, making it hard to judge. Once again, the girls picked Khadija’s as the better one, but they all agreed Salman’s drawing had crazy details. Salman wasn’t satisfied, so he called his friend Musa, who without hesitation said Salman’s was better. Still, that didn’t convince the others, so Salman just played along. Deep down, he knew he was the real winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          After their last meeting, Salman and Khadija left the school as art-challenge friends. Salman didn’t imagine they’d meet again, so he forgot about her. But fate had other plans. While scrolling on Instagram, Salman saw a familiar face in his account suggestions — it was Khadija. Excited, he clicked on the account, confirmed it was her, and followed her, hoping she’d follow back. He even sent her a reel about artists to get her attention, but days passed and she didn’t notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, the school later called all the exam candidates for a meeting. Only a few students showed up, including Salman and Khadija. After the meeting, as everyone gathered outside, Khadija stood by herself using her phone. Salman, who was nearby with friends, noticed her and felt something telling him to go talk to her. He walked up and greeted her. She smiled and said, “Hey.” Salman asked, “Did you see my Instagram account? I followed you.” She checked and realized she hadn’t noticed because she had multiple accounts. She followed him back and explained that the account he found wasn’t her main one. Salman asked why she had so many accounts, and she just smiled and said, “I just like it that way.”
        </p>
        <p>
          They didn’t talk much at the time, but at least she had followed him back and replied to his message. That meant they had a chance to keep communicating even after school. Later that day, after going to the mini-mart with friends, Salman returned and found most students had gone home. Only a few remained, including Khadija. This time, Salman and Khadija started having a deeper conversation without even realizing it. They introduced themselves properly and talked a lot. That day, they truly understood each other better. If not for that moment, they wouldn’t have connected the way they did.
          And that was an unexpected bound.
